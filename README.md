# melotronome
drum training metronome - random melody generator

My first android app idea;
Every musician should know the benefit of practising to a metronome, especially drummers - but the process can be monotonous.
By creating a random repeating series of notes at variable tempos and time signatures, the melotronome takes drum practise to a whole new level, engaging the musical part of the brain as well as focusing on timing. 

GUI created with kivy.
Pygames midi engine. 

GUI is currently basic, utilising buttons to change time signature, and a slider to change tempo. 
Program is functional but once sound generation has started, tempo and time signature can't be edited until sound has been stopped, reducing fluidity of usage. 

Am yet to upload to Android device.
